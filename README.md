#**English to Leet**
The program gets the input message from the user.

For each character(key) in the given message, the function *encrypt()* looks up the dictonary for the equivalent set of values assigned to that particular key and randomly chooses one and replace it.

If any character is not a part of the dictionary, then the  *encrypt()* function just returns the same character.
